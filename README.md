# 📊 Task-01: Population Distribution Visualization - Prodigy Data Science Internship

## 🧾 Description

This repository contains my solution for **Task-01** of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship. The task was to create a **bar chart or histogram** to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. I chose to visualize the **total population of countries** using data from the **World Bank**.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [World Bank Population Data (SP.POP.TOTL)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)
- **Content**: Total population by country over several years.

---

## 📊 Objective

- To create a **bar chart** displaying the **Top 10 most populous countries in 2022**.
- Use Python data visualization libraries to explore and present the data.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📒
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

---

## 📌 Steps Followed

1. Loaded the World Bank dataset using `pandas`.
2. Filtered the dataset to extract the population data for the year 2022.
3. Sorted the countries by population and selected the top 10.
4. Created a **horizontal bar chart** using `seaborn`.

## 📈 Output

The final visualization is a clear bar chart showing the **Top 10 countries by total population in 2022**, helping to compare and understand global population distribution easily.
